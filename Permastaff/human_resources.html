            Human resources compliance is complex and the area of greatest
            exposure to any business. FMLA, EEOC, ADA, HIPAA, COBRA, FLSA, and
            FCRA are just a few of the federal laws that regulate your
            management of employees. Yet, HR compliance is typically assigned to
            a clerical employee untrained in these complicated legal issues.
            Protect your business by allowing PermaStaff to manage your HR
            compliance.
