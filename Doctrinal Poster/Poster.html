          At the beginning of the semester when we were studying the first part
          of Genesis, I was very intrigued by the story of what happened in the
          Garden of Eden and the Fall of Man. This topic has always been so
          interesting to me and I don't think my learning and understanding of
          it will ever stop.

        <p class="bannerTextB">
          Though the Fall of Man is a complex doctrine and I've come to learn a
          lot more about it in recent life experiences and on my mission, I
          wanted to gain more insight into why good people can experience
          miserable suffering, why death is a necessary part of the plan, and
          how much of the story is literal and how much of it is figurative.

          This is a question that I believe many people have been asking since
          the beginning of time. It's actually a question that I got asked a lot
          on my mission and sometimes I just didn't quite know what to say.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've come to realize that there is not one right answer to this
          question, and that's ok. It doesn't mean that God doesn't have a plan
          or that he's just watching everything play out. I know that the Plan
          of Salvation is real and that God knows the beginning from the end and
          everything will happen the way it is supposed to happen (and it's
          important that we do our part as well). It's because of this that I'm
          able to have and exercise faith in times of uncertainty. That in and
          of itself could be one of the reasons that we go through sore trials
          on this earth, to build faith and learn to rely on God the Father and
          our Savior Jesus Christ. Sometimes, bad things might happen to us due
          to our own transgressions, or the transgressions of others. I don't
          think this necessarily means that God always punishes us for our
          mistakes, because he understands that we are imperfect. Godly sorrow
          is a consequence of sinning, and sometimes there are just consequences
          that follow our mistakes due to the nature of the Fall of Man.

          <p class="manapA">
            We might suffer because of the actions of others. This can be very
            frustrating and seem unfair at times. The scriptures teach that
            Christ will be the perfect judge of us all so we can rest assured
            that justice and mercy will served in the end, but it's in these
            experiences that we can learn to develop patience. Patience is
            something that I've been struggling with for a while now, but the
            story of the Israelites receiving their daily mana has opened my
            eyes a bit. I realize that God works in a similar way with us. Maybe
            we are suffering because we aren't receiving desired blessings right
            now. It could be that God is working with us little by little,
            giving us the blessings we need when we need them to prepare us for
            the blessings we desire and for greater life experiences.
          </p>
          <p class="manapB">
            Sometimes we suffer due to the simple fact that we live in fallen
            state. Our bodies are imperfect and subject to disease, sorrow and
            pain. I may not exactly know why there is so much suffering on this
            earth, but I do know if we are righteous and strive to keep God's
            commandments and follow the Savior's example we will find peace and
            happiness. We will one day be able to fully appreciate a fulness of
            joy because we have seen the bitter.

        <a id="death"><h1>Why is death necessary?</h1></a>
        <p>
          The 2nd question I had wondered about was why death is essential to
          the plan. Death itself can be a huge burden and source of sadness in
          this life, especially when it happens so suddenly, and to people who
          are so young. Though I’ve already known this throughout my life, I
          have been blessed to find many reminders throughout this class that
          death is indeed not the end of our existence.

          Here's a quote from President Nelson that is one of my absolute
          favorites:
        </p>

          />
          <p class="quote">
            “Life does not begin with birth, nor does it end with death. Prior
            to our birth, we dwelled as spirit children with our Father in
            Heaven. There we eagerly anticipated the possibility of coming to
            earth and obtaining a physical body. Knowingly we wanted the risks
            of mortality, which would allow the exercise of agency and
            accountability. This life [was to become] a probationary state; a
            time to prepare to meet God.” (Alma 12:24.) But we regarded the
            returning home as the best part of that long-awaited trip, just as
            we do now. Before embarking on any journey, we like to have some
            assurance of a round-trip ticket. Moreover, we can’t fully
            appreciate joyful reunions later without tearful separations now.
            The only way to take sorrow out of death is to take love out of
            life.”
          </p>
          <p class="reflection">
            Just as birth is the start of our mortal existence, death is the end
            of our mortal existence on earth, but it also opens up the doors to
            the next part of our spiritual progression. Death is the means in
            which we can return to be in the presence of our Father in Heaven
            and of our loved ones who have passed on. It is the way in which our
            bodies transition from a state of imperfection to a state of
            perfection through the resurrection. Like President Nelson said, I
            think we will realize that when we are resurrected and reunited with
            those we love, that reunion will be that much sweeter because of the
            separation caused by death.
          </p>

        <a id="literal"><h1>How Much of it is Literal or Figurative?</h1></a>
        <div class="quesC">
          
          <p class="a">
            The third question I had regarding the Fall of Man, or the Garden of
            Eden in general was how much of the story was literal and how much
            was figurative. One thing we know for certain is that Adam and Eve
            did exist. They were real people and were even seen by Jospeh
            Fielding Smith in a vison of the spirit world. Some parts of the story may be literal (we don't know for sure) but
            even if that is the case, it doesn't take away any meaning or
            significance from the story.
          </p>
          
      
          <p class="c">
            An author named Jospeh Fielding McConkie says that “The imagery used
            to veil the account of Eve's birth is most beautiful, particularly
            so in a day when there is so much confusion about the role of women.
            Symbolically, she was not taken from the bones of Adam's head nor
            from the bones of his heel, for it is not the place of woman to be
            either above the man or beneath him. Her place is at his side, and
            so she is taken, in the figurative sense, from his rib-the bone that
            girds the side and rests closest to the heart."
          </p>

          <p class="d">
            So really, it's not necessarily important to know whether that story
            was literal or figurative, but it's important to know that men
            and women are equal and should be side by side. What it comes down
            to is that we should not always try to use human reasoning to
            explain or interpret certain events in the scriptures. God's ways
            and thoughts are not our own. It's also important that we listen to
            what the spirit tells us. We know that Jesus Chirst is real, and I'm
            sure we've felt his atonement in our lives. He rose from the dead so
            that we one day might do the same, and there's nothing figurative
            about that. With this knowledge, and the knowledge we have of the
            Gospel and of the Plan of Salvation, I don't think we should be
            worrying about whether or not there were actually giants in the book of
            Genesis.
