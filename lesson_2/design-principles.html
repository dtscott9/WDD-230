            I believe that the Spotify Homepage is a good example of Hick's law. Basically, Hick's
            law is the idea that a user shouldn't be bombarded with options when going to a web-page,
            and that it shouldn't be hard for them to decided what to do from there. The Spotify home 
            page is clean and gives the user just a few options. Up top, the user can select from a few
            playlists or songs they recently listened to. Below that is suggestions of albums or podcasts
            the user might enjoy based on what they listen too, and then at the very top the user can
            simply search for what they are looking for if they prefer.

   <div class="article_content">

       <p>
           The Apple web-page is full of good examples of the rule of thirds. To explain,
           the rule of thirds is a rule in designing that helps web developers, designers,
           and artists to know where to put the most important aspects of the page. It is
           called the rule of thirds because developers will imagine
           a grid splitting the picute or page into thirds. The areas where the lines of the
           grid cross are where the user's eyes tend to look first. I think Apple applied this 
           principle well because on each of the pages that show a product of their's 
           (the MacBook Pro in this pic) the button to learn more is directly where the grid lines 
           intersect.

   <h2 class="hick">Proximity</h2>
    </header>
   <div class="article_content">
       <img src="images/proximity.png" alt="Main menu on Microsoft web-page" id="i_3"/>
       <p>
          I feel that this page I found on the official Microsoft website demonstrates well
          the principle of proximity. Basically, the rule of proximity means that designers 
          should focus on making sure that things related to each other stay close to one 
          another on the web page. I think that Microsoft does this very well on this page
          because on the top part of the page, they have buttons that lead to different deals
          and accessories all together in a cone like shape. On the bottom of the page, they have
          what looks to be an ad for the Surface Pro 7 with a picture and description of the product.
       The other two pages also follow this rule.
