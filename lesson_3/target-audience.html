     <h2>Target Audience</h2>
     <hr/>
     <p>I suspect that the main target audicence of this website would be someone who has recently started
         a business, or someone who is looking into starting a business. One factor that could help them to
         find success would be to network with other business owners in the area and exchange ideas and advice.

     <p>Another potential audience fot this website could be employees of businesses that
         have a membership in the chamber of congress. They may just want to be in the loop
         of events and programs involving the business that are in.
